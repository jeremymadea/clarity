Clarity is a small framework for building web apps and web services on. 

This is its first public release. I've used it on a handful of projects. 

It requires MDB2 (default) or DB (rename db_database.php). 

The tests require PHPUnit. PhpDocumentor is recommended for generating the
docs. They aren't included in the repo. 

Files under dev/ include some tools and some extra documentation.
