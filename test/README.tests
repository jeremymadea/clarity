The tests in this directory are dependent on the PHPUnit framework.

Tests should require "test_framework.php" and should include a call to 
run_me(). This allows tests to be run individually using: 

$ php5 testname.test.php

When a new test is added, a require "testname.test.php" should be added to the 
runtests.php script. This allows all tests to be run with the command:

$ ./runtests.php

Don't forget to copy your config.php to the tests directory first.

New tests should be constructed using the PHPUnit framework. Please refer to 
the documentation at:

http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.phpunit.php
